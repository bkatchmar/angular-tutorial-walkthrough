# Introduction
This repo's main intention is to get the necessary Angualr installs onto my new laptop as well as spearhead an Angualr App into my personal GitHub. I am basically going to use [The Official Angular Site](https://angular.io/tutorial) in order to build this but using a different data set to power the app.

This was built entirely in Visual Studio Code.

Once this repo was made, the following commands were run;

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new english-monarchs
```

To serve, simply run these commands

```
cd english-monarchs
ng serve --open
```
